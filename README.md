## 👋 Hey, I’m Jesse

I’m a **full-stack developer based in Seattle** focused on building user-centered, production-ready web applications. I care deeply about clean UX, thoughtful architecture, and turning ambiguous ideas into reliable products.

I’ve worked across the stack — from APIs and databases to polished UI — and enjoy collaborating closely with clients and teams to ship meaningful software.
