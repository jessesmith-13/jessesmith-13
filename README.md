## 👋 Hey, I’m Jesse

I’m a full-stack developer based in Seattle focused on building user friendly, shippable web applications. I care deeply about clean UX, strong architecture, and turning ambiguous ideas into reliable products.

I’ve worked across the stack - from APIs and databases to polished UI - and enjoy collaborating closely with clients and teams to ship impactful software.
